[MiniReader]

----------- what is this?

this is a little application for reading books
right now it is only works with pdf files

----------- how to build

Inside this project there should be "books" folder,
if it's not here, create it. This folder will contain
all of your pdf files (later you will have option to
load pdf file from another place).

to load your pdf file, execute build.bat with the
name of the book you are loading as command-line
argument, like this:

C:\MiniReader> build my_book.pdf

later I will add support for gui loading with
custom directories.
